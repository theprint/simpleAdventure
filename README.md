simpleAdventure is a text based exploration game, originally coded in 2 days as a Python exercise.

I made an adventure game! Over the last couple of weeks, I have gone through the Python learning path over on Codecademy. When I was done, I decided to give myself a challenge, which was to write a working game in 2 days, using Python.

I ended up with simpleAdventure, a text based game of exploration. You begin at home in the middle of a randomly generated world map, which is all of 5x5 tiles large. As you move around the world, you can explore each area and find either monsters or gold. Over time you will earn enough experience to level up, making your character tougher. Once you have explored the entire map, a wizard will teleport you to a new world, and the game continues.

What is linked here is the source code itself, which you will have to run yourself if you want to play it (need help? https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+run+a+python+script). If you know how to code and would like to add or modify anything, feel free to do so!
